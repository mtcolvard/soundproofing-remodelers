        'I used Lee as a consultant to understand how to approach my noise problem; my woodworking studio and our house kitchen share a common door. He gave me such a good education that I started an incremental approach myself.\n It turned out to be an enormous bargain. I purchased exactly the materials I needed, and didn\'t waste a penny on anything I didn\'t. Perhaps most importantly, Lee kept me from pursuing techniques that wouldn\'t have worked nearly as well. Lee was a pleasure to work with and took an active interest in my project. Highly recommended.',

        'Other contractor\â€™s consultations consisted of measuring the space and pointing out noises that could improve. Lee was the only one who pointed out structural quirks that could mean underlying complications. I appreciated the crew\'s attention to detail vs. rushing to meet a deadline. Our old building was far from a straightforward job, but Lee\'s decades of experience showed, and I don\'t think I would\'ve felt so confident or at ease with anyone else.',

With our project, we split our payments based on completion benchmarks, and he served as the coordinator amongst the structural engineer, city planning department, building inspector, and his construction crew... And what a finished product! Lee and his team did an absolutely amazing job.',
